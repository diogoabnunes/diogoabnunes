- 👋 Hi! I’m [Diogo](https://github.com/diogoabnunes) and I just completed my Master's Degree in Informatics and Computing Engineering at @FEUP.
- 🙋‍♂️ I consider myself to be very organized, dedicated, resilient and a perfectionist because I don't like to leave anything half done.
- 👀 The areas that most attract me are Software Development, Artificial Intelligence and Databases and I have knowledge of several programming languages, such as Python, C and its variants, Java, HTML, Javascript, React, Kotlin, Haskell, Prolog, SQL, among many others.
- 🚀 My biggest interests and professional motivations are essentially to evolve, grow, learn and teach a little with my future work colleagues every day, because we all have something to learn and something to teach others daily.
- 🏊‍♂️ I'm also a high-performance swimmer and I have participated in 2 Open Water Junior European Championships, which boosted me to develop several additional skills.
- 🎲 As hobbies, I like listening to music, singing, playing the piano, driving and spending time with my friends.
